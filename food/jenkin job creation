# Jenkins Job Setup Steps
# ==============================

# 1. Installed Jenkins on local Windows machine
#    - Accessed Jenkins via http://localhost:8080
#    - Unlocked Jenkins using initial admin password
#    - Installed suggested plugins
#    - Created first admin user

# 2. Verified Jenkins service
#    - Command: net start Jenkins
#    - Checked Jenkins UI working properly

# 3. Created a new Jenkins Job
#    - Job Type: Freestyle Project
#    - Job Name: FOOD-ITEM-JOB

# 4. Configured Source Code Management (SCM)
#    - Selected Git
#    - Repository URL: https://github.com/Prasanth-Thottempudi/FOOD-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.git
#    - Branch: main
#    - No credentials used for public repo

# 5. Configured Build Steps
#    - Step: Invoke top-level Maven targets
#    - Goals: clean install
#    - Ensured POM.xml is at project root (or provide -f path)

# 6. Configured Post-build Actions (optional)
#    - Could trigger notifications or downstream jobs
#    - Not configured in initial setup

# 7. Ran the Job
#    - Observed console output
#    - First error: Couldn't find POM.xml -> ensured correct path
#    - Fixed branch mismatch (master vs main)
#    - Rebuilt successfully after corrections

# 8. Common Issues Encountered
#    - ERROR: The goal you specified requires a project to execute but there is no POM in this directory
#      -> Solution: Ensure correct POM location and branch
#    - Git branch mismatch (job defaulted to master, repo uses main)
#      -> Solution: Set branch in SCM to 'main'

# 9. Summary of Job Execution Flow
#    - Pull code from GitHub
#    - Build Spring Boot project using Maven
#    - Optional: Build Docker image and deploy (if added later)
#    - Console shows success or failure messages
